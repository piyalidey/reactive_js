# Async_JS_Reactive_Exercises
Solution of all the problems listed in http://reactivex.io/learnrx/ as taught in Async JS class on FrontendMasters by jafar Hussain


This is a series of interactive exercises for learning Microsoft's Reactive Extensions (Rx) Library for Javascript. So why is the title 
"Functional Programming in Javascript"? Well it turns out that the key to learning Rx is training yourself to use functional programming 
to manipulate collections. Functional programming provides developers with the tools to abstract common collection operations into 
reusable, composable building blocks. You'll be surprised to learn that most of the operations you perform on collections can be accomplished
with five simple functions (some native to JavaScript and some included in the RxJS library):

1. map
2. filter
3. concatAll
4. reduce
5. zip
